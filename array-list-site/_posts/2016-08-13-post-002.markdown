I am writing this post in markdown via Vim with the Welcome to Jekyll post shown adjacent to it. I have added this to the '_posts' directory. Here's an attempt at a code snippet in Java:

{%highlight java%}
public static void main(String[] args)
{
    System.out.println("Hello World"!);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's an attempt at a code snippet in C:
{%highlight c%}
int main()
{
    printf("Hello World!");
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's post this and see how it looks.
