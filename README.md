# ArrayList
Test ArrayList class for working with Git in the shell. 

The ArrayList worked well in Java. It gets tricker doing it in C.

Made some changes on a local branch. I will merge the new branch with the local master branch, and then push the local master to the remote repo. If I committed from the new branch to the remote, the local master would be behind (but that could easily be fixed).
